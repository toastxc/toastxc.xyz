## Responsibly Disclosing Bugs/Vulnerabilities
<div class="holder">
    I (ToastXC) maintain a lot of software, mainly by myself. Most of the software is for fun but some are used by other people and as such I have the responsibly to ensure that it is secure. And as users of my services/software you have the responsibility to privately report critical bugs to me.

## Copyright
<div class="holder">
    Most of the software I create is licensed under GNU/GPLv3, if a certain creative work has an unspecified license assume that it is GPLv3. While there are many differences between 'All Rights Reserved' and Copyleft licenses both are legally binding and failure to abide by either is unlawful and grounds for taking legal action.

## Abuse & CoC
<div class="holder">
    If any members of the community (Minecraft, Revolt, Jellyfin or other) are behaving in a way
