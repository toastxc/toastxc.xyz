## Responsibly Disclosing Bugs/Vulnerabilities
<div class="holder">
    I (Toast) maintain a lot of software, mainly by myself. most of the software
    is for fun but some are used by other people and as such I have the Responsibly
    to ensure that it is secure. And as users of my services/software you have the
    responsibility to privately report critical bugs to me.
