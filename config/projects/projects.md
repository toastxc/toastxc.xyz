## Adduce
<div class="holder">
    Adduce is a single-page static site generator, it can be used to easily and quickly generate web-pages and bundle them into a monolithic HTML file for easy deployment. Adduce takes a different approach to SSG, the elements are split up into markdown files that can be organised and ordered. The project is still very new and has many more features planned. The site you're reading from was made using Adduce!

## PodboY
<div class="holder" >
    The main problem with podman is also one of its greatest attributes - there is no main daemon. While this provides redundancy improvements the task of managing systemd files manually can be annoying and for many is not worth the benefits podman provides. PodboY installs and manages systemd scripts generated by podman in a simple CLI similar to docker-daemon
